alt = "Hugrid Theme"
description = "This is a solid Birch wood end-grain cutting board. It features an inlay of a dragonfly. The inlay is made of end-grain Walnut. This is a one-of-a-kind design only available here in my Etsy shop. I've only made one and this is it. Think of it more as art in your kitchen! This cutting board is made to last. The end-grain is great for knives and won't dull them as quickly as other wooden cutting boards that are face grain. Most clients choose never to cut on my inlay boards and instead display them in the kitchen. This is an hand-made piece that can be passed down for generations."
